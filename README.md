# StakeAssist
**StakeAssist** is a custom Old School RuneScape bot script to assist with staking.

This script was made ages ago when I was actively playing RuneScape and needed a script, so I decided to open source it.

### Features

* Highlights friends that are in the area.
* Alerts the user when an a user on the friends list enters the area.
* Idle Prevention

### Setting Up

* [OSBot](https://osbot.org/)
* Compile as a JAR and run like any normal script.

### License

**Note: Botting in RuneScape is against the in-game rules. I am not liable if any bans occur while using this script.**

This script is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to do whatever you'd like with the code.
